All my friends are heathens take it slow

Wait for them to ask you who you know

Please don't make any sudden moves

You don't know the half of the abuse

All my friends are heathens take it slow

Wait for them to ask you who you know

Please don't make any sudden moves

You don't know the half of the abuse

Welcome to the room of people
Who have rooms of people that they loved one day

Docked away

Just because we check the guns at the door
Doesn't mean our brains will change from hand grenades

You're never know on the psychopath sitting next to you
You're never know on the murderer sitting next to you
You'll think how'd I get here sitting next to you

But after all I've said please don't forget

All my friends are heathens take it slow

Wait for them to ask you who you know

Please don't make any sudden moves

You don't know the half of the abuse

We don't deal with outsiders very well

They say newcomers have a certain smell
You have trust issues not to mention

They say they can smell your intentions

You're never know on the freakshow sitting next to you
You'll have other weird sitting next to you
You'll think how did I get here sitting next to you
But after all I've said please don't forget

All my friends are heathens take it slow

Wait for them to ask you who you know

Please don't make any sudden moves

You don't know the half of the abuse
