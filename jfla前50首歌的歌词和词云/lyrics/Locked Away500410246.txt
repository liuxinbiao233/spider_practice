If I got locked away

And we lost it all today

Tell me honestly would you still love me the same
If I showed you my flaws

If I couldn't be strong
Tell me honestly would you still love me the same

If a judge for life me would you stay by my side

Or is you gonna say goodbye

Can you tell me right now

If I couldn't buy you the fancy things in life

Baby would it be alright

Come and show me that you are down

Now tell me would you really ride for me

Baby tell me would you die for me

Would you spend your whole life for me

Would you be there to always hold me down
Tell me would you really cry for me

Baby don't lie to me

If I didn't have anything

I wanna know would you stick around
If I got locked away

And we lost it all today

Tell me honestly would you still love me the same
If I showed you my flaws

If I couldn't be strong

Tell me honestly would you still love me the same

All I want is somebody real who don't need much

I mean that I know I can trust

To be here when money low

If I did not have nothing else to give but love

Would that even be enough

Boy I need to know

Now tell me would you really ride for me

Baby tell me would you die for me

Would you spend your whole life for me
Would you be there to always hold me down
Tell me would you really cry for me

Baby don't lie to me

If I didn't have anything

I wanna know would you stick around
If I got locked away
And we lost it all today

Tell me honestly would you still love me the same
If I showed you my flaws

If I couldn't be strong

Tell me honestly would you still love me the same
Tell me tell me would you want me

Tell me tell me would you call me

If you knew I wasn't balling

Cause I need a boy
Who's always by my side
Tell me tell me do you need me

Tell me tell me do you love me

Or is you just tryna play me

Cause I need a boy to
Hold me down for life

If I got locked away
And we lost it all today

Tell me honestly would you
Still love me the same

If I showed you my flaws
If I couldn't be strong

Tell me honestly would you
Still love me the same
If I got locked away

And we lost it all today

Tell me honestly would you
Still love me the same
If I showed you my flaws

If I couldn't be strong

Tell me honestly would you
Still love me the same
