If I told you this was only gonna hurt
If I warned you that the fire's gonna burn
Would you walk in
Would you let me do it first
Do it all in the name of love
Would you let me lead you
Even when you're blind
In the darkness in the middle of the night
In the silence when
There's no one by your side
Would you call in the name of love
In the name of love name of love
In the name of love name of love
In the name of love
In the name name
In the name name
If I told you we could bathe in all the lights
Would you rise up come
And meet me in the sky
Would you trust me
When you're jumping from the heights
Would you fall in the name of love
When there's madness
When there's poison in your head
When the sadness leaves
You broken in your bed
I will hold you in the depths of your despair
And it's all in the name of love
In the name of love name of love
In the name of love name of love
In the name of love
In the name name
In the name name
I wanna testify
Scream in the holy light
You bring me back to life
And it's all in the name of love
I wanna testify
Scream in the holy light
You bring me back to life
And it's all in the name of love
