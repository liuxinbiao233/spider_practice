I used to rule the world

Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning I sleep alone

Sweep the streets I used to own

I hear Jerusalem bells a ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field

For some reason I can't explain

Once you go there was never
Never an honest word

And that was when I ruled the world

I used to roll the dice feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing

Now the old king is dead long live the king
One minute I held the key

Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand

Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

I hear Jerusalem bells a ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field

For some reason I can't explain

Once you go there was never
Never an honest word

And that was when I ruled the world
