Uh-oh, running out of breath, but I
Oh, I, I got stamina
Uh-oh, running now, I close my eyes
Well, oh, I got stamina
uh-oh, I see another mountain to climb
But I, I got stamina
uh-oh, I need another love to be mine
Cause I, I got stamina
Don't give up I won't give up
Don't give up no no no
Don't give up I won't give up
Don't give up, no no no
I'm free to be the greatest, I'm alive
I'm free to be the greatest here tonight, the greatest
The greatest, the greatest alive
The greatest, the greatest alive
uh-oh, running out of breath, but I
Oh, I, I got stamina
Uh-oh, running now, I close my eyes
But, oh, I got stamina
oh yeah, running to the waves below
oh I, I got stamina
oh yeah, I'm running and I'm just enough
uh-oh, I got stamina
Don't give up; I won't give up
Don't give up, no no no
Don't give up; I won't give up
Don't give up, no no no
I'm free to be the greatest, I'm alive
I'm free to be the greatest here tonight, the greatest
The greatest, the greatest alive
The greatest, the greatest alive
Oh-oh, I got stamina
Oh-oh, I got stamina
Oh-oh, I got stamina
Oh-oh, I got stamina
