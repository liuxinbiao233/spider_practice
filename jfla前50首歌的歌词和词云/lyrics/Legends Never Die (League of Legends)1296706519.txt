Legends never die when the world is callin' you
Can you hear them screaming out your name?
Legends never die
They never lose hope when everything's cold
And the fighting's near
It's deep in their bones
They run into smoke when the fire is fierce
Oh, pick yourself up 'cause

Legends never die
Legends never die
They're written down in eternity
But you'll never see the price it costs
The scars collected all their lives
When everything's lost, they pick up their hearts and avenge defeat
Before it all starts, they suffer through harm just to touch a dream
Oh, pick yourself up 'cause

Legends never die
