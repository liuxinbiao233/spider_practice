She works the night
By the water
She's gonna stress
So far away
From my father's daughter
She just wants a life for her baby
All on her own
No one will come
She's got to save him
She tells him
Uh
Love
No one's ever gonna hurt you
Love
I'm gonna give you all of my love
Nobody matters like you
She tells him
Your life ain't gonna be nothing like my life
You're gonna grow and have a good life
I'm gonna do what I've got to do
So
Rockabye baby
Rockabye
I'm gonna rock you
Rockabye baby
Don't you cry
Somebody's got you
Rockabye baby
Rockabye
I'm gonna rock you
Rockabye baby
Don't you cry
oh~Rockabye
Now she gotta a six year old
Trying to keep him warm
Trying to keep out the cold
When he looks her in the eyes
He don't know he's safe
When she says
She tells him
Uh
Love
No one's ever gonna hurt you
Love
I'm gonna give you all of my love
Nobody matters like you
She tells him
Your life ain't gonna be nothing like my life
You're gonna grow and have a good life
I'm gonna do what I've got to do
So
Rockabye baby
Rockabye
I'm gonna rock you
Rockabye baby
Don't you cry
Somebody's got you
Rockabye baby
Rockabye
I'm gonna rock you
Rockabye baby
Don't you cry
oh~Rockabye
oh~Rockabye
