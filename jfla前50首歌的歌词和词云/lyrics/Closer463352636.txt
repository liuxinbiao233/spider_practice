Hey
I was doing just fine before i met you
I drank to much and thats an issue
But I'm ok
Hey
Tell your friends it was nice to meet them
But i hope i never see them again
I know it breaks your heart
Moved to the city in a broke down car and
4 years no calls
Now You're looking pretty in a hotel bar
And I can't stop
No I can't stop
So baby pull me closer
In the back seat of your Rover
That i know you cant afford
Bite the tatoo on your shoulder
Pull the sheets right of the corner
Of the mattres that you stole
From your roomate back in Boulder
We ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older
You look as good as the day i met you
I forgot just why i left you
I was insane
Stay and play that Blink 182 song
That we beat to death in Tuscon, ok?
I know it breaks your heart
Moved to the city in a broke down car and
4 years no calls
Now I'm looking pretty in a hotel bar
And I can't stop
No I can't stop
So baby pull me closer
In the back seat of your Rover
That i know you cant afford
Bite the tatoo on your shoulder
Pull the sheets right of the corner
Of the mattres that you stole
From your roomate back in Boulder
We ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older
