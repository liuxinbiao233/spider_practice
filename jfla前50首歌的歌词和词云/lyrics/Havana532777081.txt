Havana ooh na na
Half of my heart is in Havana ooh na na
He took me back to East Atlanta na na na
All of my heart is in Havana
There's somethin' 'bout his manners
Havana ooh na na
He didn't walk up with that how you doin'
He said there's a lot of girls I can do with
I'm doin' forever in a minute
And papa says he got malo in him
He got me feelin' like
Oooh oooh ooh I knew it when I met him
I loved him when I left him
Got me feelin' like
Oooh oooh ooh and then I had to tell him
I had to go oh na na na na na
Havana ooh na na
Half of my heart is in Havana ooh na na
He took me back to East Atlanta na na na
All of my heart is in Havana

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I knew it when I met him, I loved him when I left him
Got me feelin' like, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
And then I had to tell him, I had to go

Half of my heart is in Havana ooh na na
He took me back to East Atlanta na na na
All of my heart is in Havana
