I've been here all night
I've been here all day
And boy got me walkin' side to side
I'm talkin' to ya
See you standing over there with your body
Feeling like I wanna rock with your body
And we don't gotta think 'bout nothin'
I'm comin' at ya
Cause I know you got a bad reputation
Doesn't matter cause you give me temptation
And we don't gotta think 'bout nothin'
These friends keep talkin' way too much
Saying I should give you up
Can't hear them no cause I
I've been here all night
I've been here all day
And boy got me walkin' side to side
I've been here all night
I've been here all day
And boy got me walkin' side to side
Been tryna hide it
Baby what's it gonna hurt if they don't know
Makin' everybody think that we solo
Just as long as you know you got me
And boy I got ya
Cause tonight I'm making deals with the devil
And I know it's gonna get me in trouble
Just as long as you know you got me
These friends keep talkin' way too much
Saying I should give you up
Can't hear them no cause I
I've been here all night
I've been here all day
And boy got me walkin' side to side
I've been here all night
I've been here all day
And boy got me walkin' side to side
