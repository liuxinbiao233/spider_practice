For all the time that you rain on my parade
And all the clubs you get  in using my name
You think you broke my heart
Oh girl, for goodness sake
You think I'm crying on my own, well I ain't
And I didn't wanna write a song
Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't but you still hit my phone up
And baby I'll be moving on
And I think you should be something
I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job
Didn't see what's going on but now I know
I'm better sleeping on my own
Cause If you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And If you think that I'm still holding on
To something, you should go and love yourself
When you told me that you hated my friend
The only problem was with you and not them
And everytime you told me my opinion was wrong
And try to make me forget where I came from
And I didn't wanna write a song
Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't but you still hit my phone up
And baby I'll be moving on
And I think you should be something
I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job
Didn't see what's going on but now I know
I'm better sleeping on my own
Cause If you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And If you think that I'm still holding on
To something you should go and love yourself
