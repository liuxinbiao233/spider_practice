Wait a second, let me catch my breath
Remind me how it feels to hear your voice
Your lips are movin', I can't hear a thing
Livin' life as if we had a choice
Anywhere, any time
I would do anything for you
Anything for you
Yesterday got away
Melody stuck inside your head
A song in every breath
Sing me to sleep now
Sing me to sleep
Won't you sing me to sleep now？
Sing me to sleep
Lost in your mind
I wanna know
Am I losing my mind
Never let me go
If this night is not forever
At least we are together
I know I'm not alone
I know I'm not alone
Anywhere, whenever
Apart but still together
I know I'm not alone
I know I'm not alone
